### Updating Prusa Firmware
#### What you need:
  * .hex file you intended to update with
  * PrusaSlicer (or Slic3r PE)

#### Steps:
General description about updating Prusa firmware provided by the Prusa Research can be found [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/r5ByKgVm69-firmware-upgrade-and-flashing).

1. Download our .hex file (prusa3d_fw_MK3S_3_7_2_Miyagi.hex) or generate your own .hex file
    - The type of Prusa 3D printer we used was MK3S, and the firmware version was 3.7.2. In case you have a different type of printer or wish to use a later firmware version, you need to generate your own .hex file. Follow detailed instructions under [our Software directory].
    
2. Connect your Prusa 3D printer to your computer.

3. Open the PrusaSlicer, click on the Configuration menu and select the .hex file in your local computer.

4. Flash!
